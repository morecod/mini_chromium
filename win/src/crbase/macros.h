// The arraysize(arr) macro returns the # of elements in an array arr.  The
// expression is a compile-time constant, and therefore can be used in defining
// new arrays, for example.  If you use arraysize on a pointer by mistake, you
// will get a compile-time error.  For the technical details, refer to
// http://blogs.msdn.com/b/the1/archive/2004/05/07/128242.aspx.

// This template function declaration is used in defining arraysize.
// Note that the function doesn't need an implementation, as we only
// use its type.

//   if (TakeOwnership(my_var.get()) == SUCCESS)
